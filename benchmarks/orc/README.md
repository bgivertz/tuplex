## Orc Benchmarks
The following four scripts are used to benchmark Orc reading and writing against
Tuplex's CSV implementation:
1. `runcsv-read-single.py`
2. `runcsv-write.py`
3. `runorc-read-single.py`
4. `runorc-write.py`

## Usage
In order to run the benchmarks, you must first import a CSV and Orc file
containing the same dataset. Then, you may run the benchmarks using the 
arguments provided in their files.
